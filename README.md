# MultiOgar-Edited

[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/407210435721560065/embed.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/27v68Sb)

A fast, open source [Agar.io](http://agar.io/) server that supports multiple protocol versions and smooth vanilla physics.

Since August of 2016, [Barbosik](https://github.com/Barbosik) has stopped working on this project. So I forked the code and remade it into MultiOgar-Edited, an updated version of the previous MultiOgar.

# Information
Current version : **1.6.1**

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-node.js-yellow.svg)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHE2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Barbosik/OgarMulti/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

Original MultiOgar code is based on the private server implementation [Ogar](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar). The original code rightfully belongs to the [OgarProject](https://github.com/OgarProject).

MultiOgar-Edited code however, is based on MultiOgar code that has been heavily modified and improved by many collaborators. The overall goal of this fork is to make physics as vanilla as possible, cleanup most of the code, and add lots of new features while maintaining better performance than the original MultiOgar.

# Discord Bot Support

If you would like to allow a moderator to get direct access to your server's commands, you may want to set up a Discord bot on your server.

The setup is very simple, all you need is a Discord App Token and a role on your server.
Both can be specified in the config within the file.

After this is complete just run the `console-discord.js` file in the `run` folder and your server will start along with the bot.
