# This is the MultiOgar-Edited configurations file.
# [NOTES]
# Lines starting with hashtags are comments, not configs.
# MultiOgar uses size configuration instead of mass for performance purposes (so does Agar.io).
# The equation for size to mass calculation is: SIZE * SIZE / 100 = MASS.
# You can use the 'mts(mass)' syntax instead of doing the above calculation to find the correct size value.
